      <p>
        Film Atlas is a passion-driven project created to help people explore,
        discover, and appreciate films and television shows from across the
        world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our focus is on curation, education, and discovery. We organize and
        present publicly available content alongside metadata, reviews, and
        recommendations to make exploration easier and more enjoyable.
      </p>

      <p>
        We benefit from the work of public digital libraries such as the
        Internet Archive, whose preservation efforts help make film history and
        educational media accessible worldwide.
      </p>

      <p>
        Film Atlas does not host or store any video files. All media content is
        embedded from third-party public archives and platforms that make such
        content available.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project is operated as a non-commercial, hobby initiative with the
        goal of supporting film culture, accessibility, and learning.
